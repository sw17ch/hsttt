Simple tic-tac-toe game in Haskell.

To run:

```
runhaskell main.hs
```

When prompted, enter your move as a combination of two digits. The first is the
X coordinate (from 0 to 2). The second is the Y coordinate (from 0 to 2).

Some examples:
  - "11" - center cell
  - "00" - top left cell
  - "02" - bottom left cell
  - "20" - top right cell
